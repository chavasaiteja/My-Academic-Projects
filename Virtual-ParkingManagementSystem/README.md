# Virtual-ParkingManagementSystem
Data Structures Project which simulates different Parking Methods using Efficient Data Structures in CPP

Different Parking Techniques or Systems used in implementation are:

1.Linear Way Parking

2.Floor Parking

3.Floor Lift Parking

4.Street Parking

5.Round Parking

All the above Techniques are implemented using various Data Structures like LinkLists,Stacks,Queues,Hashing,Trees and Graphs.

All these code and algorithums can, directly be used in development of Parking Software with all above systems in one place.It has various 
Social and Commercial Benifits.
